# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview: 

A potential outside investor for a new surf and ice cream shop has requested additional due diligence before financially committing. They have asked for a weather analysis for the island of Oahu, Hawaii where the shop will be located. The analysis will look at the months of June and December to determine if this niche shop will be feasible.

## Results: 

  * During the month of June, the temperature range for the island of Oahu was 64'-85', with an average temperature of 75'. During the month of December, the temperature range was 56'-83', with an average temperature of 71'.
  
  * The months of June and December had temperature dispersion of 3.3' and 3.7, respectively.

## Summary: 

Given the relatively consistent temperatures in the months of June and December the success of a surf and ice cream shop appear likely. However, in addition to analyzing the temperatures for June and December it's recommended a thorough year-round temperature analysis be performed as well. It would also be prudent to include a wind analysis to ensure the island can offer optimal surfing conditions.
